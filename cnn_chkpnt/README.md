CNN weights for translating from AA to 3Di.

Used in [this script](https://github.com/mheinzinger/ProstT5/blob/main/scripts/predict_3Di_encoderOnly.py) to predict 3Di directly from AA using only the ProstT5-encoder (without running the decoder which is inherently slow due to its sequential decoding).
